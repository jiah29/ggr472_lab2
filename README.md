GGR472 Lab 2 - Jia Hao Choo

This repository contains my work for Lab 2 of GGR472: Developing Web Maps (Winter 2024), which focuses on creating a web map using Mapbox GL JS on a custom basemap styled using Mapbox Studio. 
The web map consists of two different data sources: GeoJSON and maptiles.

The purpose of the web map is to introduce some of my favourite locations in Toronto, namely parks and restaurants, which are both provided as point features from GeoJSON source and vector maptile respectively. Basic features like subway stops and neighbourhoods are also provided in the custom basemap style and as a vector maptile polygons respectively.
